(read more in [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website).\n\nIn FontAweswimm, we add the icons svg's straight out of the mockups in Figma, run a short \"icon generation script\" (that creates updated `ttf`, `woff` and a \"wrapper\" \\`svg) and push it to develop.\n\n## Steps to add a new Icon\n\n1.  Go to Figma, select the new icon to add and export it:\n    \n    ![image.png](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/swimmio-content/o/repositories%2FveezvxCuzpPrRLLXWD2E%2Fimg%2Ff7c35cfe-0bcd-4573-befa-2fac26988dd2.png?alt=media&token=921b530e-b797-46bb-86d4-fb2c0053d5ae)\n    \n    1.  Select The icon inside the mockup page\n        \n    2.  On the left SideBar, make sure that you selected the entire icon, not only a part of it\n        \n    3.  On the right SideBar, click \"export\" (if not visible, right click on the Icon and select \"export\")\n        \n    4.  Export the Icon as `SVG`\n        \n2.  Save the icon in our project in the path `src/glyphs`\n    \n3.  Update The [[sym:./package.json(eb7a88d9-4866-4d9b-934d-c6c51956e125)]] file with a new patch version\n    \n4.  Make sure that the new icon has a proper name, commit the icon and push it to github  \n    You'll notice that when you create the ps a github action will start and build the projects\n    \n5.  Merge your PR\n    \n6.  after build you need to set a new [release version in GitHub](https://github.com/swimmio/fontaweswimm/releases) and point it to your branch\n    \n7.  Now you can pull the branch locally and use your new icon ðŸ‘‘\n    \n\n![image.png](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/swimmio-content/o/repositories%2FveezvxCuzpPrRLLXWD2E%2Fimg%2F2903c8c1-12d1-4b2f-8de4-a2fa054178e5.png?alt=media&token=daada0db-89f2-45f1-8fd4-fba07d349308)\n\n## The build process workflow\n\nFor a better understanding of how the iconset is being generated, you can always look at the [[sym:./.github/workflows/build_fontaweswimm.yml(d0cbd791-0d03-4465-a557-5983a1ffa2a5)]] workflow file and the conversion library that we use: [[sym:./src/scripts/icons2fontaweswimm/original_project_readme.md(7bce6221-1b9b-48ea-9468-0d50e58b2e43)]]"
