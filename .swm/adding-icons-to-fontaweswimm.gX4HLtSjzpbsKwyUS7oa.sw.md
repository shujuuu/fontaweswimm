# Intro

In Swimm, We use lots of icons to express ourselves :)

to see the icons that we already have, open in your browser the file `ðŸ“„ src/fonts/fontaweswimm/demo.html`

Sometimes, @Emiliya or @Shuju adds a new Icon in the mockup that should be included in a new feature we develop.

## FontAweswimm

Since we are Swimm and we are awesome ðŸ˜Ž , we have our own "variation" of [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

fontawesome is an iconset/toolkit that helps holds vector icons, that are easy to use and customize. (read more in [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website).

In FontAweswimm, we add the icons svg's straight out of the mockups in Figma, run a short "icon generation script" (that creates updated `ttf`, `woff` and a "wrapper" \`svg) and push it to develop.

## Steps to add a new Icon

1.  Go to Figma, select the new icon to add and export it:

    1.  Select The icon inside the mockup page
        
    2.  On the left SideBar, make sure that you selected the entire icon, not only a part of it
        
    3.  On the right SideBar, click "export" (if not visible, right click on the Icon and select "export")
        
    4.  Export the Icon as `SVG`
        
2.  Save the icon in our project in the path `src/glyphs`
    
3.  Update The `ðŸ“„ package.json` file with a new patch version
    
4.  Make sure that the new icon has a proper name, commit the icon and push it to github  
    You'll notice that when you create the pr a github action will start and build the projects
    
5.  wait for this action to finish and make sure it changes the font files before merging your PR!
    
6.  Merge your PR
    
7.  after build you need to set a new [release version in GitHub](https://github.com/swimmio/fontaweswimm/releases) and point it to your branch
    
8.  Now you can pull the branch locally and use your new icon ðŸ‘‘

## The build process workflow

For a better understanding of how the iconset is being generated, you can always look at the `ðŸ“„ .github/workflows/build_fontaweswimm.yml` workflow file and the conversion library that we use: `ðŸ“„ src/scripts/icons2fontaweswimm/original_project_readme.md`

## Using fontaweswimm in Swimm

In order to use the new icons you added in our Swimm app you need to install the new version you just created.

Good Luck :)
