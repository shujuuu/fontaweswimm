Intro
=====

In Swimm, We use lots of icons to express ourselves :)

![image.png](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/swimmio-content/o/repositories%2FveezvxCuzpPrRLLXWD2E%2Fimg%2F64d7db2b-0e78-4199-8b57-878fdaca56c1.png?alt=media&token=14051dbc-dac0-4a0f-a070-4937d530820c)

to see the icons that we already have, open in your browser the file `src/fonts/fontaweswimm/demo.html âœ“`

Sometimes, @Ilana or @Shuju adds a new Icon in the mockup that should be included in a new feature we develop.

FontAweswimm
------------

Since we are Swimm and we are awesome ðŸ˜Ž , we have our own "variation" of [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

fontawesome is an iconset/toolkit that helps holds vector icons, that are easy to use and customize. (read more in [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website).

In FontAweswimm, we add the icons svg's straight out of the mockups in Figma, run a short "icon generation script" (that creates updated `ttf`, `woff` and a "wrapper" \`svg) and push it to develop.

Steps to add a new Icon
-----------------------

1.  Go to Figma, select the new icon to add and export it:

    A. Select The icon inside the mockup page B. On the left SideBar, make sure that you selected the entire icon, not only a part of it C. On the right SideBar, click "export" (if not visible, right click on the Icon and select "export") D. Export the Icon as `SVG`
    
2.  Save the icon in our project in the path `src/glyphs`
    
3.  Update The `package.json âœ“` file with a new patch version
    
4.  Make sure that the new icon has a proper name, commit the icon and push it to github.
    
5.  In github, go to the "Actions" tab and select `Build Fontaweswimm` workflow:

6.  Now, after the branch is pushed with the new `svg`, click on **"Run Workflow"** and select your branch to generate the updated fontaweswimm iconset:

7.  Now you can pull the branch locally and use your new icon ðŸ‘‘

The build process workflow
--------------------------

For a better understanding of how the iconset is being generated, you can always look at the `.github/workflows/build_fontaweswimm.yml âœ“` workflow file and the conversion library that we use: `src/scripts/icons2fontaweswimm/original_project_readme.md âœ“`

**Notice** - after build you need to set a new [release version in GitHub](https://github.com/swimmio/fontaweswimm/releases)
